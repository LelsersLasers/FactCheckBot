# Fact Check (and Bot)

Final project for HONR 199: Millan, Shay, and Joao. Uses AI (in our case ChatGPT), to check the truth of statements. It can do it automatically in real time, or you can go back and check old statements.

## Commands

```
!check # reply to a message to check the truth of the statement
!check <statement> # check the truth of the statement

!auto on # enable auto checking
!auto off # disable auto checking
```
